Project Description: 

Create an Automotive Dealer Website system where customers can find different  automotive dealers in their region 
and search/browse for the cars they are looking for. Customers can also express interest to a dealer on the car they 
are interested in through a lead form. Automotive Dealers should be able to manage their Inventory (ability to 
add/delete/modify their vehicles on their lot). Automotive Dealers can also create Incentives on certain types of 
vehicles to create a demand for vehicles.

Use case 1: Customers (aka as Car Shoppers) should be able to find the dealers in their proximity and select the 
dealer they are interested in interacting with.
