	In the final project, our team is for customer searching parts. After assigning the groups, teammates started to communicate about their thoughts for this project. The very first difficulty would be what customers usually would think. We came up allowing access to address, searching with zip code, searching with states/cities, searching dealers, getting to know the maps. We have noticed that we need dealer data for map implementing and dealer searching. We created a list to record what we need. 
	After team 8 seems in charge of data, we communicated with them directly and hoped we can meet. We prepared a list of data attributes and several questions about date. While we shared our zoom links, other groups seem have several questions and joined as well. Literally, we made the meeting become to all groups meeting. While we were discussing the data, there were many questions came up: whether using zip code as searching method, preparing datasets not only creating the class, dividing the tasksâ€¦Then, we arranged our own group meeting. We send messages to our TA and professor to discuss the problems we faced. 
	At the meantime, our team lead Yun has divided our tasks into three parts: fetching data + search logic/algorithm (Lakshimi), GUI and user interaction design (Yun and Tejaswi), implementing map and calling google maps APIs (Chang). We all chose our parts. After discussing with TA and professor, TA had posted the datasets on the Github. After we reviewed it, we realized that there are many locations are duplicated and marked in a wrong place (cities and states), which means that we need to correct the data. We searched the dealers name with address and changed the wrong information. Also, we added the latitude and longitude into the table, and separated the zip code and state code. Thus, we can pined the dealers location on the maps.
